# Introduction

This is just a collection of my experiments using [AFrame](https://aframe.io/)
for webVR development. Some of the things in here are available to try at [my
website](https://webvr.decodingsteve.com/).

My personal webVR setup is a GearVR/Oculus Go, so most of my experiments are
designed explicitly to be compatible with 3doF systems and their controllers.
To the extent possible I _try_ to make things at least somewhat compatible with
simpler setups, (like Google Cardboard and it's clones), but I can't guarantee
that, just like I can't promise, (due to lack of access), that anything here
will work particularly well in more advanced 6doF systems like Rift or Vive.
