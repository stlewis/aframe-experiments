# Introduction

This is just a collection of my experiments using [AFrame](https://aframe.io/)
for WebVR. Because most of the things I'll be playing around with involve
writing and/or improving various components, the bulk of my work can be found
in the top-level `components` folder. That folder is symlinked inside of each
individual project folder.

Each project folder contains a brief README describing what it's purpose is.
Documentation for the components found in the `components` folder can be found
in the `docs` folder, unless the component is just me hacking around
temporarily rather than trying to build something permanent.

If you have any questions about anything, please feel free to open up an issue.
If you'd like to make an improvement to something I have here, I'm always open
to pull requests.
