# Introduction

This is just a collection of my experiments using [AFrame](https://aframe.io/)
for WebVR. Because most of the things I'll be playing around with involve
writing and/or improving various components, the bulk of my work can be found
in the top-level `components` folder. That folder is symlinked inside of each
individual project folder.

Each project folder contains a brief README describing what it's purpose is.
Documentation for the components found in trhe `components` folder can be found
in the `docs` folder, unless the component is just me hacking around
temporarily rather than trying to build something permanent.
