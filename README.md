# Introduction

This is just a collection of my experiments using [AFrame](https://aframe.io/)
for webVR development. Some of the things in here are available to try at [my
website](https://webvr.decodingsteve.com/).

As should be obvious by my use of the word "experiments", nothing in here should be considered stable or useful in any meaningful way. However, to the extent that any of this stuff is helpful to you in creating your own WebVR content, please feel free to shamelessly steal my work.

Until recently, the most advanced VR I had access to was an Oculus Go, which limited my ability to experiment and build things to 3DoF VR. Having now gotten my hands on an Oculus Quest, I'm able to do much more, and many of my future experiences will reflect my newfound freedom in that regard.
