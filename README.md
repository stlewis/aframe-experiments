# Introduction

This is just a collection of my experiments using [AFrame](https://aframe.io/)
for webVR development. Everything here is available to try at [my
website](webvr.decodingsteve.com/examples/).

My personal webVR setup is a GearVR/Oculus Go, so most of my experiments are
designed explicitly to be compatible with 3doF systems and their controllers.
To the extent possible I _try_ to make things at least somewhat compatible with
simpler setups, (like Google Cardboard and it's clones), but I can't guarantee
that, just like I can't promise, (due to lack of access), that anything here
will work particularly well in more advanced 6doF systems like Rift or Vive.

Each individual experiment contains it's own README that will explain what the
project is and what it's minimum required setup is.
